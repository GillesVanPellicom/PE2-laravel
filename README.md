Mockup end-to-end logistic management system made in Laravel.

Final assignment for the Thomas More Practice Enterprise 2 course (YT6276), academic year 2024-2025.

## Documentation

We use the built-in [Wiki](https://github.com/GillesVanPellicom/PE2-laravel/wiki) feature in Github to keep track of documentation. Here you can find guides and help on most topics relevant to our work. You can find more information about the Wiki on the Wiki itself.

The wiki contains critical project information that everyone must read to stay aligned and informed. Make sure to read it.

## Run Project Locally

Although this project could potentially run on XAMPP, bare metal, or other environments, it is strongly recommended to use the [included setup process](https://github.com/GillesVanPellicom/PE2-laravel/wiki/Local-Setup-Process). This approach is streamlined to ensures proper functionality and maintains consistency across all devices and operating systems. As an added bonus this also makes it greatly easier for us deploy our app to the server. 

If you encounter difficulties with your own setup or prefer a hassle-free option, following the provided setup instructions is strongly advised.

## Sprint Tracking

Sprints, tasks, ownership and story points are tracked using the Github projects feature. Read more about how we do this [here](https://github.com/GillesVanPellicom/PE2-laravel/wiki/Sprint-Tracking). This is the way your individual performance will be graded. Be sure to understand the process fully.

## CSS

For UI styling, we do not create custom CSS styles.

Without oversight, consistency between departments cannot be maintained, which was allegedly criticized at last year's presentation. But although it was criticized, it's a supposedly ungraded aspect of the project. Knowing this, allocating resources for oversight to an ungraded aspect of this project is not justified and therefore we will not be making our own house-styles.

Still, even when not strictly required, having every UI element pushed to the top-left corner is very unpleasant to work with.

Therefore, as an easier alternative, we have chosen to work with a pre-made styling solution, tailwind.

- [Usage guide](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/styling-with-utility-classes), for people without prior tailwind experience.
- [Component gallery](https://tailwindui.com/components), for browsing pre-made tailwind UI components.

Also, if anyone were to need icons for their UI, [Bootstrap Icons](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/) is a large, free icon library where every icon can be pasted hassle-free straight into HTML, no image handling required or installation.
