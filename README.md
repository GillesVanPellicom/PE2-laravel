## Documentation

We use the built-in [Wiki](https://github.com/GillesVanPellicom/PE2-laravel/wiki) feature in github to keep track of documentation. Here you can find guides and help on most topics relevant to our work. You can find more information about the Wiki on the Wiki itself.

## Run Project Locally

Although this project could potentially run on XAMPP, bare metal, or other environments, it is strongly recommended to use the [included setup process](https://github.com/GillesVanPellicom/PE2-laravel/wiki/Local-Setup-Process). This approach ensures proper functionality and maintains consistency across all configurations and devices. If you encounter difficulties with your own setup or prefer a hassle-free option, following the provided setup instructions is strongly advised.

## Sprint Tracking

Sprints, tasks, ownership and storypoints are tracked using the Github projects feature. Read more about how we do this [here](https://github.com/GillesVanPellicom/PE2-laravel/wiki/Sprint-Tracking).

## CSS

For UI styling, we do not create custom CSS styles.

Without oversight, consistency between departments cannot be maintained, which was criticized last year. Altough it was criticized, it's a supposedly ungraded aspect of the project. Allocating resources for oversight to an ungraded aspect of this project is not justified.

Still, even when not strictly required, having every UI element pushed to the top-left corner is very unpleasant to work with.

Therefore we have chosen to work with a pre-made styling solution, tailwind.

- [Usage guide](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/styling-with-utility-classes), for people without prior tailwind experience.
- [Component gallery](https://tailwindui.com/components), for browsing pre-made tailwind UI components.

Also, if anyone were to need icons for their UI, [Bootstrap Icons](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/) is a large, free icon library where every icon can be pasted hassle-free straight into HTML, no image handling required.
